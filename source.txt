a group of colleagues got together to visit their old university professor.conversation soon turned into complaints about stress in work and life .offering his guests coffee ,the professor went to the kitchen and returned with a large pot of coffee and many styles -porcelain,plastic,glass ,some expensive, some exquisite ,telling them to help themselves to the coffee.when all the students had a cup of coffee in hand ,the professor said:if you noticed ,all the nice looking expensive cups were taken up,leaving behind the plain and cheap ones. while it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves ,that is the source of your problems and stress.indeed, what all of us really want is coffee, not the cup .we consciously go for the best cups,and then we begin eying other's cups.so is our life. life is the coffee,the jobs ,money and position in society are the cups. they are just tools to hold our life and the cups can't change the quality of the life we live.sometimes,by concentrating only on the cup ,we fail to enjoy the coffee god has provided us .god just brews the coffee ,not the cups. so enjoy our coffee!the happiest people don't have the best of everything,and they just make the best of everything.so love generously !care deeply! live simply! leave the rest to the god !
